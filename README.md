AI Chat Support Bot
Welcome to the AI Chat Support Bot project! 

This chatbot is designed to provide users with quick and accurate answers to their questions. Whether you're looking for product information, support, or just a friendly greeting, our bot is here to assist!

Features 
Instant Responses: Get quick answers to frequently asked questions.

Context-Aware: Understands your intent and provides relevant responses.

Simple Setup: Easy to run and deploy locally for testing and development.

Analytics Dashboard: Track the most common intents and user interactions in real time.

Customizable: Easily add new intents, questions, and responses to make it your own.

Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
Python: The backbone of the bot, handling logic, responses, and integrations.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive and user-friendly UI to interact with the bot.

Hugging Face Transformers: We use pre-trained models for NLP tasks, including intent recognition and response generation.

Pandas: For storing and analyzing chatbot interaction data (analytics).

JSON: Used for storing intents (questions, responses) for the chatbot.

Flask: Handles integration and routing when running in production.

Getting Started üöÄ
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.6+)

Pip (for managing Python packages)

Installation
Clone the Repository

Open a terminal/command prompt and clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/ehteshan6/AI-Chatbot
cd ai-chabot
Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the required libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the Intent Data

Make sure the intents.json file is present and properly formatted in the project folder. This file contains all the predefined questions and responses for the chatbot.

Run the App

Once everything is set up, run the following command to launch the chatbot:


streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit server, and you can interact with the chatbot through your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

How It Works 
User Interaction: The user asks a question or makes a request (e.g., "What is your product?").

Intent Recognition: The chatbot uses NLP techniques to understand the user's intent and match it with predefined questions in the intents.json file.

Response Generation: Once an intent is identified, the bot provides a relevant response, such as information about the product or support details.

Analytics: Each interaction is logged, and you can view analytics on common queries and bot usage.

Features in Development üîß
We have plans to enhance the bot with additional features, including:

Sentiment Analysis: To detect the user's mood and adjust responses accordingly.

Multi-Language Support: Provide the bot in multiple languages to cater to a global audience.

Voice Interaction: Enable voice-based inputs and responses for a more interactive experience.
